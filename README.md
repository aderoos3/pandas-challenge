## Anaylsis and Organizing of school district data

The goal of this project is the clean or organize the raw data from schools in a school district. The data was then organized at a district snapshot and school snapshot. The data was arranged and analyzed through a variety of lenses that gives a good overall of the state of each school in the district and the district overall. This repository has the Jupyter Notebook, the two csv files and a word document with analysis. 

Opening up the file with the code will show how the csv files were transformed into readable DataFrames. The assignment did come woth some hints, so I wasn't starting from scratch. First, I was able to go through all the district data by finding the total schools, total students, total budget, average math scores, average reading scores, percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and percentage passing both. I used these metrics for each school as well. Except I did school type and budget per student. Then I found the best and worst performing schools. I found the average scores and percentages by grade. I found how the testing scores were affect by budget, size and type of school. 

Hopefully, this program will split up the data by ticker and then show key tickers will big changes to look out for.
